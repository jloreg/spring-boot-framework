## 7. Section Introduction - Connecting Web Application with JPA

In the last section we talked about JPA, in this section, we would get back to our Spring Boot Web Application. When initially developed a Spring Boot Web Application we were using an in-memory ArrayList to store our data.

In this short section, we would update our Spring Boot web application to connect to the database. We'll upgrade our web application to use JPA and define entities for Todo, and also we'll create a TodoRepository and connect to the in-memory database H2.
